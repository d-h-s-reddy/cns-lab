Affine cipher:
The affine cipher is a monoalphabetic substitutional cipher where in each letter is mapped to the particular equivalent numeric number.
encryption is done by using the simple mathematical function and back into the original letter

The whole process is based on the modulo m(the length of teh alphabet used).in affine the letters of an alphabet of size m are mapped to the integers in the range 0,...m-1.

the key has two numbers a and b
The value of a should be prime.
Encryption:
 It uses the modular arithmetic to transfer the integer plaintext to teh ciphertext.
The encryption funtcion is: E(x)=(ax+b) mod m
m=size of the alphabet
a and b:are keys
note: a and m should be co primes

Decryption:
 In decryption we shuld use the opposite of the funtcion to obtain the plaintext from the ciphertext
The function is:D(x)=a^-1(x-b)mod m
a^-1 :modular mulitiplicative inverse of a modulo m
